In cryptography, public and private keys are used in a key pair system for encryption, digital signatures, and other security protocols. Here's a breakdown of each:

1. Private Key:
A secret key known only to the owner.
Used for decryption of messages or signing digital documents.
Should never be shared or exposed.
In the context of blockchain wallets (e.g., Ethereum, Solana), the private key is what allows you to authorize transactions.
If someone gains access to your private key, they have full control over your wallet and funds.
2. Public Key:
Derived from the private key using a mathematical process.
Can be freely shared with others.
Used to encrypt data that only the private key can decrypt or to verify digital signatures created by the corresponding private key.
In cryptocurrencies, the public key (or its hash, like an Ethereum or Solana address) is where people can send funds to.
Example in Asymmetric Encryption (like RSA, ECDSA):
Encryption:
A sender encrypts data using the recipient's public key.
Only the recipient can decrypt it using their private key.
Digital Signatures:
A signer uses their private key to create a signature.
Anyone can verify this signature using the signer's public key.
