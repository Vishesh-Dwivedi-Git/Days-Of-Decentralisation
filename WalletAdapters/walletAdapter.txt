How Wallet Adapters Work
Connection: The adapters facilitate connecting to the wallet using a consistent API. When a user wants to connect a wallet, the adapter presents the available wallets and handles the connection process.

State Management: Adapters manage the connection state, allowing applications to respond dynamically to wallet connections or disconnections.
