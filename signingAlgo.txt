In Solana, the signing process relies on asymmetric encryption using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically the Ed25519 signature scheme. This algorithm ensures both security and efficiency for verifying the authenticity of transactions. Here’s a breakdown of the components:

1. Ed25519 Signing Algorithm:
Ed25519 is a type of elliptic curve signature scheme based on the Edwards-curve family of elliptic curves. It offers high performance and strong security properties.
Curve: It uses the elliptic curve known as Curve25519, which is designed to provide strong security while being resistant to timing attacks.
Key size: The public keys and signatures in Ed25519 are both 32 bytes long.
Private Key: The private key is a 64-byte value, derived from a seed of 32 bytes.
2. How Signing Works:
The signing algorithm in Solana works in three key stages:

Key Generation: The private key is generated from a random 32-byte seed. The corresponding public key is derived using elliptic curve point multiplication on the Curve25519.

Signing: To sign a message (or a transaction in Solana), the Ed25519 algorithm uses the private key and the message to generate a unique signature. This signature ensures that the message hasn’t been tampered with and can only be created by the owner of the private key.

Verification: The public key is used to verify that the signature corresponds to the signed message. The Ed25519 verification process ensures that:

The signature matches the public key.
The message hasn’t been altered.
Only the holder of the corresponding private key could have signed the message.
3. Properties of Ed25519:
Fast Signing and Verification: Ed25519 is highly optimized for fast signature generation and verification, which is crucial for Solana’s high-performance blockchain.
Deterministic: Ed25519 is deterministic, meaning the same private key and message always produce the same signature, unlike other algorithms that introduce randomness.
Compact: The signatures and keys are small (32 bytes), which helps in reducing the size of transactions and improving overall network performance.
4. Why Ed25519 for Solana?
Security: Ed25519 provides 128 bits of security, which is currently considered safe against all known attacks.
Performance: Solana needs fast cryptographic operations to handle its high transaction throughput, and Ed25519 provides this efficiency.
Resistance to Side-Channel Attacks: The design of Ed25519 makes it resistant to side-channel attacks, which are a common concern in cryptographic algorithms.
In summary, Solana uses the Ed25519 signing algorithm for signing transactions. This algorithm provides a robust balance of security and performance, which is essential for a high-throughput blockchain like Solana.
