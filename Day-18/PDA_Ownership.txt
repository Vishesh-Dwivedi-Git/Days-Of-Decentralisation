Characteristics of PDAs
Deterministic Nature:

PDAs are generated using a predictable algorithm based on the program ID and the provided seeds. This means that given the same inputs, you will always derive the same PDA.
The derivation is done using the findProgramAddress function, ensuring that multiple parties can compute the same address independently.
Non-Transferrable Ownership:

PDAs are not owned by any private key, which means they cannot be transferred or controlled by a user. Instead, they are controlled exclusively by the program that created them.
The program must have a mechanism to validate operations performed on the PDA to ensure security and correctness.
Immutable Addresses:

Once a PDA is created, its address cannot be changed. This immutability is important for data integrity.
Creating a PDA
To create a PDA, you will typically use a combination of:

Program ID: The public key of the program that will control the PDA.
Seeds: A sequence of bytes or strings that uniquely identify the PDA. You can use user-specific information or fixed strings as seeds.
