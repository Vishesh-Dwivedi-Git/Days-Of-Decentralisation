An immutable ledger in the context of blockchain refers to a database that cannot be altered or deleted once data is recorded. Each block of information is cryptographically linked to the previous one, creating a chain of blocks (hence the term "blockchain"). This immutability is one of the core principles of blockchain technology and is critical for ensuring:

Transparency: All transactions can be traced back and verified by anyone, as every change or addition to the ledger is visible.
Data Integrity: Once data is added to the ledger, it cannot be tampered with or changed without altering every subsequent block, which is virtually impossible due to consensus mechanisms and cryptographic security.
Trustless Environment: Participants in a blockchain network don't need to trust one another; they rely on the ledger's immutability and consensus protocols to ensure that data remains accurate and trustworthy.
This quality of immutability makes blockchain technology particularly suitable for applications where data integrity and transparency are crucial, such as financial transactions, supply chain tracking, and secure record-keeping.
