Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) provide developers on Solana with two main use cases:

- **Deterministic Account Addresses**: PDAs provide a mechanism to deterministically derive an address using a combination of optional "seeds" (predefined inputs) and a specific program ID.
- **Enable Program Signing**: The Solana runtime enables programs to "sign" for PDAs which are derived from its program ID.

## Properties

- PDAs are addresses derived deterministically using
    - a combination of user-defined seeds
    - a bump seed
    - and a program's ID.
- PDAs are addresses that fall off the Ed25519 curve and have no corresponding private key.
- Solana programs can programmatically "sign" for PDAs that are derived using its program ID.
- Deriving a PDA does not automatically create an on-chain account.
- An account using a PDA as its address must be explicitly created through a dedicated instruction within a Solana program.
