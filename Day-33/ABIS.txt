In the context of Ethereum and smart contracts, ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) are crucial for interacting with contracts. Hereâ€™s an overview of what ABIs are and how they work:

What is an ABI?
Definition: An ABI defines the methods and structures of a smart contract, essentially serving as a bridge between the smart contract's bytecode and the application that interacts with it. It specifies how to encode and decode data for function calls and responses.
Key Components of an ABI:
Function Definitions:

Each function in a smart contract has a corresponding entry in the ABI that includes:
The function name.
The types of its inputs and outputs.
Whether the function is read-only (constant/view/pure) or modifies the state (non-constant).
Event Definitions:

Events emitted by the smart contract are also defined in the ABI, allowing applications to listen for and respond to these events.
Constructor Information:

Information about the constructor of the contract is included, detailing the parameters required to deploy the contract.
