MINT TOKEN ACCOUNT :
A mint token account in the context of Solana refers to an account that holds information about a particular token mint. This account is created and managed as part of the Solana Token Program, and it's essential for handling token-related operations such as minting, transferring, and managing token balances.

Key points about a mint token account:

Mint Account Structure:

Mint: This represents the token being created or managed. It's a unique account that holds the metadata and details of the token, such as the supply, the authority to mint or freeze, and the number of decimals the token supports.
Owner:

The owner of the mint account is the authority that can mint new tokens or have permissions to freeze token accounts. This is typically set when the mint account is initialized.
Supply Control:

A mint token account tracks the total supply of the token and allows certain accounts (with minting authority) to create new tokens and distribute them as needed.
Associated Token Accounts:

While the mint token account holds information about the token itself, each user or program interacting with the token will have an associated token account to store their balance of that particular token.
Minting New Tokens:

When tokens are minted, the mint token account is updated to reflect the change in total supply, and the tokens are usually sent to a specific user's associated token account.
