TanStack Query (formerly known as React Query) is a powerful data-fetching library for React applications. It helps manage server state, including fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating data in your application. Itâ€™s especially useful for scenarios where you need to interact with APIs, databases, or external data sources, offering a clean and efficient way to handle server-side data without manual state management.

Key Features of TanStack Query:
Data Fetching and Caching: Automatically caches fetched data and reuses it whenever possible, reducing unnecessary network requests.
Automatic Background Updates: Keeps data fresh by automatically refetching data in the background at intervals you specify or based on user activity.
Synchronized Server State: Ensures the client is synchronized with the server state, preventing stale data.
Pagination and Infinite Scroll Support: Handles pagination, infinite loading, and fetching more data as needed.
Prefetching: Fetches data before it's needed, allowing for a smoother user experience.
Out-of-the-Box Support for Error Handling: Makes error handling straightforward, with built-in retry logic for failed requests.
Optimistic Updates: Provides optimistic updates, letting you update the UI instantly while waiting for the server's response.
Devtools: Comes with a handy set of devtools that allows you to inspect and debug queries, mutations, cache, etc.
