wagmi is a fantastic React Hooks library designed to simplify Ethereum dApp development. It focuses on managing Ethereum wallet connections, interacting with smart contracts, and handling blockchain data, all while being highly flexible and easy to use.

Key Features of wagmi:
Wallet Connection:

Supports popular wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet.
Provides hooks like useAccount, useConnect, and useDisconnect for wallet management.
Smart Contract Interaction:

Easily call smart contract functions with useContractRead, useContractWrite, and manage contract states.
Ethereum Data:

Use hooks like useBalance, useBlockNumber, and useNetwork to get Ethereum-specific data.
Integration with Tanstack Query (React Query):

Since wagmi uses React Query internally, you get the benefits of automatic caching, background fetching, and request deduplication for blockchain data.
