In Solana, the Token Program is a system program that provides a common implementation of fungible and non-fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain. It allows developers to create, transfer, burn, and manage tokens, similar to ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards on Ethereum. Here are some key features of the Solana Token Program:

Key Concepts:
Mint: A mint is the source of a token, responsible for issuing the tokens. When a token is created, it has a mint account that manages its supply.
Token Accounts: Users hold tokens in token accounts. Each token account can hold one type of token associated with a specific mint.
Owner: The user or program that has control over a token account or mint.
Associated Token Account (ATA): This is a specialized token account that is linked to a user's wallet and a specific mint, making it easier to manage token balances.
Transfers: Users can transfer tokens between accounts, similar to how regular token transfers work in other blockchains.
Burn: Tokens can be destroyed or "burned" from circulation by sending them back to the mint.
Common Token Program Functions:
Create Mint: Initialize a mint to represent a new token.
Create Token Account: Create a new token account for a user to hold tokens.
Mint Tokens: Issue new tokens from the mint to an account.
Transfer Tokens: Move tokens between accounts.
Burn Tokens: Remove tokens from circulation.
Freeze/Thaw Accounts: The mint authority can freeze or thaw accounts, preventing or allowing transfers.
